PeldorFit
=========
A program PeldorFit is developed for analysis of orientation-selective Pulsed ELectron-electron Double Resonance (PELDOR or DEER) data.

Further description of the program can be found in the manual and in the paper (see below).

General Information
=========
The source code of the PeldorFit program is written in C++. The program uses two external open-access libraries, Intel TBB (https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/) and libconfig (http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/). 

The program was already compiled for Linux and Windows, the corresponding executables are stored at https://github.com/dinarabdullin/PeldorFit/releases
