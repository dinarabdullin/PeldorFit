PeldorFit
=========

Fitting of orientation selective PELDOR / DEER data by means of the genetic algorithm.

General Information
=========
This is a C++ source code of the PeldorFit program (http://www.schiemann.uni-bonn.de/research/software/peldorfit). It was compiled and tested on the 64-bit Linux and Windows operational systems, using NetBeans (g++ 4.8.2) and Mircosoft Visual Studio IDEs (Microsoft Visual C++), correspondingly.

This code uses two external open-access libraries, Intel® TBB (https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/) and libconfig (http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/). Both of them have to be specified in the library path, before the code is being compiled.
